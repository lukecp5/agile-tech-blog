## **Description**
This is a MySQL and Content Management System blog, built using the MVC(Model View Controller) paradigm. It allows users to register an account, login to their account, create blog posts, edit blog posts, and add comments to other users' blog posts. It uses MySQL and Sequelize for handling the transmission of data. It uses Express for the API routes and server. It uses Handlebars as a templating engine to handle the display of all of the blog posts and comment. The JavaScript for the login and register pages has some JQuery built-in, to account for the rapid style of development this project required.

## **Usage**
To use the blog website, simply navigate to the [server it is hosted on](https://agile-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/). Once there, you will be able to see all of the blog posts that other users have posted. If you would like to comment on other users' posts, or create posts of your own, you'll need to register for an account. Once you have registered for an account, you will be logged in automatically. You can then click 'Create Post' or go to your _dashboard_ to create a new post.
